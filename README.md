# sudoku-solver

An implementation of a sudoku solver in Python, utilising a depth-first search, completed as part of a university coursework.

I can't provide the auxillary code required for the environment to function properly, as it is not my work. 

Instead, this is intended as a representation of my experience with Python, code quality, and ability to convert algorithms into functioning code.
